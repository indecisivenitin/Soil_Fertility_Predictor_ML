# Soil Fertility Predictor ML

[Live Demo](https://soil-fertility-predictor-ml-v2.onrender.com/)

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict soil fertility based on various soil features and environmental parameters. It is designed to assist farmers, agronomists, and researchers in optimizing crop production by providing actionable insights into soil quality.

## Features

- **Light & Dark Theme:** Switch between visually pleasing light and dark modes for improved user experience.
- **Install as App:** Progressive Web App (PWA) support lets you install the predictor as a standalone application on your device.
- **Soil Data Analysis:** Upload and analyze your soil data using advanced machine learning models.
- **Fertilizer Recommendations:** Receive tailored fertilizer recommendations to enhance soil fertility.
- **PDF Soil Report:** Download detailed soil analysis and recommendations as a PDF report for sharing or recordkeeping.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Main programming language.
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** For interactive exploration and development.
- **Web Deployment:** Hosted live on Render.com.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
